Thank you for testing my website.

I used Flask Forms to get it running.

You will need to install Python first.

Then in the terminal you will need to:

pip install flask
then:
pip install flask_wtf

After that you can type:

flask run

This will allow you work through the website.
If you have any SQL issues. I am also using the sqlite3 extension on Visual Studio Code.
